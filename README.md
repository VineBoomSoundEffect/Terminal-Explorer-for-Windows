# Terminal-Explorer-for-Windows
## A file explorer with a terminal interface
### What is it?
The terminal explorer, also knows as CEX (short for command explorer) is an imitation of the good-old Windows Explorer, except it runs on a terminal, like the Command Prompt for example.
### How to use it?
You can get started with CEX by downloading the files from this repository, then installing the `cex.exe` file.
After the installation, you can run CEX by typing `cex` in the command prompt.
By default, it will show you the directory you opened the program from.
However, type the `help` argument, and a list of available commands will show, and the program will stop.
The commands are then instantly executed after you press the corresponding key.

### Coming soon:
I am planning to add new features in the future, such as:
* *Custom colors:* the folders and input text are colorated, but being able to change those colors is a nice touch
* *Selection:* it would be a lot faster to do specific actions on multiple files at once!
### Don't get mad at me, ok?
This is a very simple project, and lacks many features of the actual Windows Explorer. The idea is simply to manipulate the file structure on a computer, it's not anything fancy, like search systems and virus scanning. I hope you understand.
### Tell me what you think!
Don't be affraid to post comments and commit pull requests. I'll take all of them into consideration. Thanks!
